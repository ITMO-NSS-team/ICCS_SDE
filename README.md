# ICCS
Code for paper "Enhancing Time-Series Forecasting with Stochastic Differential Equation Discovery: An Evolutionary Approach" submitted to ICCS 2025.
The repository includes the code of numerical experiments presented in the study:
- Dynamics of the behavior of the open-price equation depending on the selected interval;
- Lotka-Volterra equation;
- Exchange rate data from GLUONTS open datasets.

###  Modules used:
- Algorithm for searching differential equations from data (https://github.com/ITMO-NSS-team/EPDE)
- Algorithm for automated solution of differential equations based on neural networks (https://github.com/ITMO-NSS-team/torch_DE_solver)
