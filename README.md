# DS2024_SDE
Code for paper Stochastic differential equation discovery using evolutionary approach submitted to Discovery Science 2024 conference.
The repository includes the results of numerical experiments presented in the study:
- Dynamics of the behavior of the open-price equation depending on the selected interval: day, month, quarter. Input data is provided.

###  Modules used:
- Algorithm for searching differential equations from data (https://github.com/ITMO-NSS-team/EPDE)
- Algorithm for automated solution of differential equations based on neural networks (https://github.com/ITMO-NSS-team/torch_DE_solver)
